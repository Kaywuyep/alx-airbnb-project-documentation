# features-and-functionalities

This directory contains the documentation outlining the key features and functionalities of the backend for the Airbnb Clone project.

## Contents

* ![alt text](airbnb_backend_features.png) : A visual representation (diagram) created using Draw.io, detailing the backend features and their functionalities, including user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments.

## Purpose

This document serves to provide a clear and visual understanding of the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project. It aids in communication among team members and stakeholders, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the system's core functionalities.

## Steps to Create the Diagram (for reference)

1.  **Access Draw.io:** Open your web browser and navigate to [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/).
2.  **Create a New Diagram:** Choose to create a new diagram. You can select a blank diagram or a template as a starting point if you find one suitable.
3.  **Identify Core Features:** Based on the project requirements (which you reviewed), identify the main functional areas of the backend (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System, Payments). These will likely be the top-level elements in your diagram.
4.  **Detail Functionalities within Each Feature:** For each core feature, break down the specific functionalities it needs to support. For example:
    * **User Authentication:** Registration, Login, Logout, Password Reset, Profile Management.
    * **Property Management:** Create Listing, Read Listing, Update Listing, Delete Listing, Search Listings, Filter Listings.
    * **Booking System:** Check Availability, Create Booking, Read Booking, Update Booking, Cancel Booking.
    * **Payments:** Process Payment, Refund Payment, Payment History.
5.  **Choose Appropriate Shapes and Connectors:** Use the shapes available in Draw.io (e.g., rectangles for features/entities, ovals for processes) and connectors (arrows to show relationships and flow) to represent the backend structure and interactions.
6.  **Structure Your Diagram:** Organize the diagram logically. You might choose a hierarchical structure where main features are at the top, with their functionalities branching out. Alternatively, you could use swimlanes to represent different parts of the system.
7.  **Add Labels and Descriptions:** Clearly label each shape and connector. Add brief descriptions if necessary to explain the purpose or flow of a particular functionality.
8.  **Review and Refine:** Once you have an initial version, review it to ensure it accurately reflects the project requirements and is easy to understand. Make any necessary refinements.
9.  **Export as PNG:**
    * Go to **File** > **Export as** > **PNG...**
    * Configure the export settings as needed (e.g., ensure a reasonable zoom level for clarity).
    * Click **Export**.
    * Choose the `features-and-functionalities/` directory within your local clone of the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` repository as the save location. Name the file `airbnb_backend_features.png`.
10. **Commit and Push:**
    * Open your terminal or Git client.
    * Navigate to your `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` repository.
    * Stage the changes: `git add features-and-functionalities/airbnb_backend_features.png`
    * Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Add diagram documenting backend features and functionalities"`
    * Push the changes to your GitHub repository: `git push origin main` (or `git push origin <your_branch_name>`)
