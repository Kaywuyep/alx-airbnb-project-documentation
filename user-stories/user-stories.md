# key use cases from your Airbnb clone diagram into user stories. Here are five user stories capturing core interactions:

1. As a guest, I want to be able to register an account so that I can browse and book properties.
2. As a guest, I want to be able to search for properties by location, date, and number of guests so that I can find suitable accommodations.
3. As a guest, I want to be able to book a property so that I can secure my stay.
4. As a host, I want to be able to list my property with details like location, amenities, and pricing so that potential guests can find and book it.
5. As a registered user (guest or host), I want to be able to manage my profile information so that my account details are accurate and up-to-date.

These user stories capture the essential interactions for both guests and hosts, directly stemming from the use cases identified in the previous task.
These user stories will be further elaborated upon with acceptance criteria and technical details during the development process. They provide a user-centric view of the backend requirements.
