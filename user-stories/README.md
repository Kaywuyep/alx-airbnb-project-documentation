# user-stories

This directory contains the user stories derived from the use case diagram created for the Airbnb Clone project. These user stories articulate the needs and goals of different users interacting with the platform's backend functionalities.

## Contents

* `user_stories.md`: A Markdown file listing the user stories translated from the use case diagram.

## Purpose

This document serves to translate the high-level interactions visualized in the use case diagram into actionable requirements from the perspective of the users (both guests and hosts). These user stories provide a clearer understanding of the system's value proposition for its users and will guide the development of the backend features.
